# Minor---Cloud-Project
This project discusses a detailed overview of developing a client server-based
application using socket programming. We will be developing a client-server-based
application called WE3 CLOUD using C programming language to demonstrate
the concepts of socket programming and its communication between server and
client..<br><br>
Interface design, socket programming style and exceptions are also considered in
the development stage. The communications between client server application
processes using socket mechanisms were mainly analyzed.
The main objective of this Project is to demonstrate the principles and concepts
behind socket programming and that too with the core idea of providing cloud
computing-based services
